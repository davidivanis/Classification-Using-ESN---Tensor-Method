# Classification-Using-ESN---Tensor-Method

The code and paper in this repository were made as a part of the course on matrix and tensor methods in data analysis.


In the paper, the standard problem of classification is solved using echo state networks. Instead of the traditional method of training the output weights of the network, a method that uses tensor decomposition is used.
The method and the paper are based on a number of articles written on the subject, as stated in the paper.
The goal was to implement the methods presented in those articles and compare the results.


The code for the paper was written in MATLAB and the method was applied to the well known MNIST collection of handwritten digits, as well as the temporal ecg data.
The method explanation, results and all the accompanying plots are presented in the paper.
The Code folder contains the code that implements the echo state networks as well as the code for Tucker-2 tensor decomposition.
